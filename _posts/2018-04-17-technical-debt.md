# {{ page.title }}

Mention “technical debt” to a fellow software engineer and she’ll instantly grasp what you mean: a past implementation you wish you had the resources to refactor or replace because it negatively impacts the performance of your team and the overall system.

When looking for the resources to tackle it, software engineers usually bring up the term “technical debt” in a meeting and try	to explain what it means to decision makers and why it is important to invest resources to reduce it. By coining the term “debt”, engineers might begin the resources negotiation with the wrong foot.

In a prudently-ran business, “debt” is a good thing. It’s financial oxigen and there is usually a well defined time-frame to pay it back. In some cases, when the terms are favorable, you’ll even want to prolong the payback as much as possible (for example, with a 1% interest rate, a 30 years mortgage sounds like a better deal than a 10 years one). In any scenario, before the debt is acquired there is an agreement of when it is going to be paid back. This is usually what “debt” means in the minds of business decision makers in charge of allocating resources; however, this is absolutely not the case on the technical side. A prudent engineer would ideally like to pay as soon as possible a technical debt for which there is initially zero agreement of when and how it should be paid.

Whether the technical debt was unintended or a conscious trade-off, stakeholders have a clearer picture if engineers remove the term from the conversation and replace it, for example, with an analogy. It could go like this:

“We have so far built the foundations and structures for a two-story house. Our business currently demands a third or even fourth floor. Unless we invest resources on building the foundations and structures for those demands, we risk having an unstable house”.

Such an analogy can be the start of a transparent conversation about risks and resources estimation; turning what initially seemed to be a business versus engineering negotiation, into a problem-solving collaboration.
