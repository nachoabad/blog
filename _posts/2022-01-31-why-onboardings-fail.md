# {{ page.title }}

Onboardings are commonly conceived as a To-Do list of introductory meetings, documentation readings and basic tasks to familiarize with code and workflows. In this approach, concrete onboarding goals are generally missing, and when you set out to do something that is not measured, it might give you an everlasting feeling that everything is fine. 

When goals are absent, onboardees spend their first weeks navigating through people, docs, repositories and small tasks, drifting away from the big picture of how it all works. I call these Organic Onboardings. In some cases, they respond to previous feedback asking for practical tasks —an urge to push code live to feel immediately productive. The belief is that by providing these opportunities the overall onboarding experience would be better. In other cases, it's a proactivity seeking process: “You’re a big boy, find your way around. We expect *you* to tell us what to do”. Spartan babies onboarding.

As an answer to goalless onboardings and my frustration of not getting full satisfaction feedback, I’ve found it useful to implement a series of walk-through sessions to answer questions like (imagine an ecommerce startup context):

“Let’s discount 10% off to a list of products for one week, using promo code ‘abc123’, applicable just for customers who have spent more than $200 this year”

During a walk-through session, the onbordee would typically explain what people and teams are involved, how data would flow, the process of deploying the changes, who needs to be communicated. The format is indeed very similar to interview questions, just that this time you are not looking for general but domain-specific expertise.

Although organic onboardings bring some value, they present two problems that the goal oriented approach solves:

**1. Missing the big picture**

The first and most important is the sooner the person has the big picture, the sooner she can contribute meaningfully. Having them pushing code might not be, from a team perspective the highest priority (not because it might be risky or poor quality, but simply there are more important things to do). Fixing a spec that hid a bug it’s a positive contribution, and it certainly hits a shot of dopamine to everyone. Pointing out a fundamental flaw on the architecture is a high impact contribution, not just a positive one. The sooner high impact contributions come, the better for the team and the company.

**2. Diversity exclusion**

The second one is that it missed out diversity. Some people thrive in unstructured environments such as the ones organic onboardings provide. Other people need structures and clear goals to grow. Why not let them decide what kind of onboarding they want? Or allow them to combine both?
